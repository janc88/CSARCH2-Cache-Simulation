# CSARCH2 Cache Simulation Project

## Overview

This project is designed as a web-based application that simulates the allocation of main memory blocks to their respective cache blocks using a Full Associative Mapping (FA) approach and First-In, First-Out (FIFO replacment algorithmww.

In FA mapping, each main memory block may be mapped to any cache block, typically starting with block 0 and continuing to fill any available blocks. However, to handle instances wherein the cache blocks may need to be replaced or overwritten, a replacement algorithm is paired with this.

In this project, the FIFO replacement algorithm is utilized which allows the main memory blocks to continue placing its data in the cache blocks even when all cache blocks are exhausted or when data is already present in the cache.
